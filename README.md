Repo for the Recipes lesson.

This project is about creating a simple group of webpages that are linked
to each other containing recipes.

Very useful to brush up beginner HTMl skills with concepts like lists, images,
anchors and the like.

Knowing how to link back and forth between subpages will also be very helpful.

Small steps...
