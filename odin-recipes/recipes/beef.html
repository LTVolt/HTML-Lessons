            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
            <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 (32 fluid ounce) container beef broth</li>
            <li>2 (.75 ounce) packets dry brown gravy mix</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon browning sauce (such as Kitchen Bouquet®)</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 bay leaf</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried parsley</li>
            <li>¼ cup Merlot wine</li>
            <li>¼ cup butter</li>
            <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 cup white rice</li>
            <li>2 (10.5 ounce) cans beef consomme</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Directions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk flour, 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, and seasoned salt in a large bowl until smooth, and toss beef tips in flour mixture to coat. Remove beef with a slotted spoon.</li>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large heavy pan or Dutch oven over medium heat; cook and stir mushrooms and 1 small chopped onion in oil until onion is translucent, about 8 minutes. Stir in seasoned beef tips and cook and stir until beef is browned and no longer pink inside, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour in beef broth and whisk dry brown gravy mix into beef mixture until smooth; stir in 1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce, bay leaf, parsley, and Merlot. Bring to a simmer and reduce heat; simmer until gravy has thickened, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a slow cooker, cover, and cook on Low for 8 hours.</li>
            <li>About 25 minutes before serving time, melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat and cook and stir 1 small chopped onion until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir rice into mixture and pour in beef consommé. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and cover. Simmer rice until tender and liquid is absorbed, about 15 minutes; let rice stand for 5 minutes covered before fluffing with a fork. Serve beef tips and gravy over rice.</li>
