Repo for the Recipes lesson.

This project is about creating a simple group of webpages that are linked
to each other containing recipes.

Very useful to brush up beginner HTMl skills with concepts like lists, images,
anchors and the like.

Knowing how to link back and forth between subpages will also be very helpful.

Small steps...

NOTE: These pages are intentionally left "bad" so as to check the learning
progress. Coming back every time to make them better or wasting too much
time initially to make them look better seems pointless, especially when
there are going to be multiple different pages to showcase later on.
